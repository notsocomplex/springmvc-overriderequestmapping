Overview and Goals

You work on a project with existing Spring MVC controller and you would like to override some method but you can't change the existing controller.
With the current implementation of Spring you get a "java.lang.IllegalStateException: Ambiguous mapping found." exeception.

The current solution will allow you to specified which method should be use using a simple annotation. (@OverrideRequestMapping)

Another important point was to be able to continue to scan the controller.


Configuration

1- Create new controller by extending the old one.
2- Add the @OverrideRequestMapping annotation to indicate which method should be use.
2- Remove <mvc:annotation-driven /> annotation
3- Add the configuration normally include into <mvc:annotation-driven />
   See spring-requestmapping-config.xml
4- Make sure the new controller is scan or declare before the old/original one
   See xml config
5- Add the CustomRequestMappingHandlerMapping from NotSoComplex
6- Make sure that the new customRequestMappingHandlerMapping is declare to override the default requestMappingHandlerMapping
	<alias name="customRequestMappingHandlerMapping" alias="requestMappingHandlerMapping"/>
	<bean id="customRequestMappingHandlerMapping" class="com.notsocomplex.core.CustomRequestMappingHandlerMapping" />


Test
1- Should register one method without any 
2- Should register one method in case an override case
